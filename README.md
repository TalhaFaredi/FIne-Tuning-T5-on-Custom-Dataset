# Summarization with HuggingFace | NLP Projects | Fine-Tuning T5 Transformer

This project focuses on implementing text summarization using HuggingFace's models, including fine-tuning a T5 transformer. Summarization in Natural Language Processing (NLP) is the process of automatically generating shorter, meaningful summaries from longer documents or texts.

## Dataset: CNN/DailyMail
The CNN/DailyMail dataset comprises around 300,000 news article-summary pairs. These summaries are **abstractive** in nature, meaning they generate new sentences rather than extracting phrases from the original text.

## Preprocessing and Model Implementation
The summarization models used are based on HuggingFaceâ€™s Transformers library. Key components include:
- **Data Handling:** Using `datasets` library to load the CNN/DailyMail dataset.
- **Model Pipeline:** Employing pre-trained models such as `t5-small` and `facebook/bart-large-cnn` for the summarization task.
- **Fine-Tuning on Custom Data:** For further improvements, the project includes fine-tuning on custom dialogue datasets like `samsum`.

## Key Features
- **Model Loading and Tokenization:** Loading and tokenizing the dataset for training and evaluation.
- **Training Setup:** Fine-tuning the T5 model using the HuggingFace `Trainer` API.
- **Evaluation:** Monitoring metrics such as loss, runtime, and performance during model training.

## Custom Summarization
The fine-tuned summarization model generates concise summaries for dialogues or articles, making it suitable for tasks like business document summarization or news summarization.
